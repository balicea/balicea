  <H2>Hello! 👋 </H2>

- 🏡 :computer: :microscope: I’m currently working on making Github commits via [Orthogonal Research and Education Lab](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab), [DevoWorm](https://github.com/devoworm), [OpenWorm Foundation](https://github.com/openworm), [Synthetic Daisies](https://github.com/synthetic-daisies), and [DevoLearn](https://github.com/DevoLearn)

- 📫 How to reach me: [E-mail](mailto:bradly.alicea@outlook.com), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/balicea1), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradlyalicea/)

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on big, unfinished (or unwieldy) ideas! Virtual Reality, Computational Developmental Biology, and Neuro/CogSci. It's the 10th Anniversary of the Hard-to-Define Events Workshop -- look for me at the [NetBioMed](https://sites.google.com/channing.harvard.edu/netbiomed2022) satellite of [NetSci 2022](https://netsci2022.net/) 🔥

- :watch: Check out my recent publications! [CV](https://balicea.github.io/CV.html)

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: open source education and associated funders. If someone has developed a good set of biology-specific emojis (:snail:, :fish:, :hatching_chick: are not sufficient for our needs), get in touch.

- :volcano: Ask me about my collection of ideas!   

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
